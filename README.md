An Investigation into Box Plots

This repository contains, primarily, a jupyter notebook with an investigation into Box PLots

The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to investigate and explain box plots and their uses. To help explain box plots, I will be using theboxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot. I will undertake this task by:

Summarising the history of the box plot and situations in which it used.
Demonstrating the use of the box plot using data
Explaining the box plot terminology
Comparing the box plot to alternative plot

To run the notebook, you must have [Jupyter] https://jupyter.org/ Installed on your machine.  You can install this using the [Anaconda] https://anaconda.org/ Python distribution.  The notebook itself is called Box Plots.ipynb (http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Box%20Plots.ipynb)
